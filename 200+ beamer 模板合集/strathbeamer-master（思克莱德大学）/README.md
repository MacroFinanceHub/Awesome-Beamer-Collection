# strathbeamer [![Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/example-pdf-green.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrogl/strathbeamer/examples/strath-example.pdf)
Strathclyde University LaTeX beamer template

Unofficial LaTeX beamer style for outstanding and professional presentations.

Colours and proportions try to follow as much as possible the [**brand rules**](http://www.strath.ac.uk/brand/) publicly available at the link http://www.strath.ac.uk/brand/

## Example

The following are images extracted from the compiled example you can find [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrogl/strathbeamer/examples/strath-example.pdf)

## Usage
The easiest way is that of cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/nitrogl/strathbeamer.git

and modify the .tex sample file (of course, rename it as you need).

If you are not starting a presentation from scratch, however, you can just copy the style file along with its directory `strathclyde`

+ strathclyde.sty
+ strathclyde/

to the base directory of your project.
Remember to include the package just below `\documentclass`, like you can see in the sample .tex file.

    \usepackage{strathclyde}

Further customisation is possible through few commands/rules.
