       \begin{itemize}
            \item <1-> This short presentation is intended to show how to make your own presentations using \LaTeX{}with the \textbf{Beamer} class
            \item <2-> As a Master of Science in Computer Science student, I find \LaTeX{} a very useful tool to make my own reports and presentations
            \item <3-> I think that because I can adapt my presentations (and my reports) to my needs, not the opposite (which tend to happen with programs that does not allow you to modify or even take a look at the \textit{source code})
        \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Introduction | \LaTeX{} installation}
       \begin{itemize}
            \item <1-> I use \textbf{Crunchbang Linux} (Waldort 11) as my OS which 
                       is \textbf{Debian} based (Wheeze 7.0)
            \item <2-> So, to install \LaTeX{} in a Debian based distro just open a terminal and type:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item sudo apt-get install texlive-full \# for the whole TeX libs
                \item sudo apt-get install texlive-base \# for the essential TeX libs
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

            quick search in \textbf{Google}
