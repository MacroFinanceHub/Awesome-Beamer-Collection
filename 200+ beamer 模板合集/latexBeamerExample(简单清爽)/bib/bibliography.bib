	of extensible software for computational biology and bioinformatics.
	The goals of the project include: fostering collaborative development
	and widespread use of innovative software, reducing barriers to entry
	into interdisciplinary scientific research, and promoting the achievement
	of remote reproducibility of research results. We describe details
	of our aims and methods, identify current challenges, compare Bioconductor
	to other open bioinformatics projects, and provide working examples.},
