----------------------------------------------

1) What you need to use this theme:
-----------------------------------
- The LaTeX-Beamer class
- Your LaTeX-Skills :)

2) How to use this theme:
-------------------------
- Easiest way: Just copy all the *.sty-files to the working directory (the directory, where you want to put your *.tex - files) and have fun!
- Second Way: Copy all the *.sty-files to your Beamer-Themes directory (e.g.: /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/ ; you should find there a lot of other theme files)

- You can have a look at the example-files to see how it works.
