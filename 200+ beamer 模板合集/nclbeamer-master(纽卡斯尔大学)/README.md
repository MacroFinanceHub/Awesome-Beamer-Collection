Newcastle University LaTeX beamer template

Unofficial LaTeX beamer style for outstanding and professional presentations.

Colours and proportions try to follow as much as possible the [**brand guidelines**](http://fms-itskills.ncl.ac.uk/docs/universitylogo.pdf), PRIVATELY available at the link http://fms-itskills.ncl.ac.uk/docs/universitylogo.pdf

## Example

The following are images extracted from the compiled example you can find [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nitrogl/nclbeamer/master/examples/ncl-example.pdf)

## Usage
The easiest way is that of cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/nitrogl/nclbeamer.git

and modify the .tex sample file (of course, rename it as you need).

If you are not starting a presentation from scratch, however, you can just copy the style file along with its directory `nclbeamer`

+ nclbeamer.sty
+ nclbeamer/

to the base directory of your project.
Remember to include the package just below `\documentclass`, like you can see in the sample .tex file.

    \usepackage{nclbeamer}

Further customisation is possible through few commands/rules.
